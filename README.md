# EECS348 Lab 7

This is a template for Lab 7 with continuous integration testing set up through a GitHub action. To the right of commits above the list of files in the repository is a green checkmark if all tests pass, or a red cross if one or more tests fail.

To begin the assignment, create a fork of this template through GitHub and then clone your fork locally to work on it. Whenever you push any commits, the tests will run and report what tests cases, if any, are still failing for your code.
