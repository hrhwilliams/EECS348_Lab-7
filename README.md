# EECS348 Lab 7

This is a template for Lab 7 with continuous integration testing set up through a GitHub action. To the right of commits above the list of files in the repository is a green checkmark if all tests pass, or a red X if one or more tests are failing.

You can see what test cases are failing or passing by clicking on the checkmark or X and clicking details on the window that pops up.

The repository contains a folder named `tests/` and a file named `CMakeLists.txt`. Don't modify these, as they contain the test cases and setup for running them in the GitHub action.

## To begin

Create a fork of this template through GitHub and then clone it locally. Whenever you push any commits, the tests will run and report what test cases, if any, are still failing for your code. You can use this to find any errors before you submit your assignment, and to be sure that your assignment is able to build on the cycle servers to be graded.
